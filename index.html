                <p class="text-muted text-left">As we look forward to a new school year, nutritiously planned and colorful school lunches will be available for your child. Breakfast and lunch will be served as part of the total education program at our school. Numerous studies have proven that a child cannot concentrate in the classroom when they are hungry. Your student's school day may begin with breakfast which costs $1.50 a day - what a bargain! The new lunch menu is planned using a Food-Based Menu Planning approach and contains 5 food components - fruits, vegetables, grains, meat/meat alternative and milk. A lunch meal must contain 3 of the 5 components with a maximum of 5 components with at least one of the components being from the fruits or vegetable component (per the USDA guidelines). Cost for lunch is still just $2.25 per day - another great bargain. The cafeteria is also featuring different fresh Farm to School items each month.

                <p class="text-muted text-left">A playground, playpark, or play area is a place designed to provide an environment for children that facilitates play, typically outdoors. While a playground is usually designed for children, some are designed for other age groups, or people with disabilities. A playground might exclude children below a certain age.Modern playgrounds often have recreational equipment such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide, jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox, spring rider, trapeze rings, playhouses, and mazes, many of which help children develop physical coordination, strength, and flexibility, as well as providing recreation and enjoyment and supporting social and emotional development. Common in modern playgrounds are play structures that link many different pieces of equipment.Playgrounds often also have facilities for playing informal games of adult sports, such as a baseball diamond, a skating arena, a basketball court, or a tether ball. Public playground equipment installed in the play areas of parks, schools, childcare facilities, institutions, multiple family dwellings, restaurants, resorts, and recreational developments, and other areas of public use</p>
